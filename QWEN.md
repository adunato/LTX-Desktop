# QWEN.md

This file provides guidance to Qwen Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LTX Desktop is an Electron app for AI video generation using LTX models. Three-layer architecture:

- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS renderer
- **Electron** (`electron/`): Main process managing app lifecycle, IPC, Python backend process, ffmpeg export
- **Backend** (`backend/`): Python FastAPI server (port 8000) handling ML model orchestration and generation

## Common Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start dev server (Vite + Electron + Python backend) |
| `pnpm dev:debug` | Dev with Electron inspector + Python debugpy |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`) and Python (`pyright`) type checks |
| `pnpm typecheck:ts` | TypeScript only |
| `pnpm typecheck:py` | Python pyright only |
| `pnpm backend:test` | Run Python pytest tests |
| `pnpm build:frontend` | Vite frontend build only |
| `pnpm build` | Full platform build (auto-detects platform) |
| `pnpm setup:dev` | One-time dev environment setup (auto-detects platform) |

Run a single backend test file via pnpm: `pnpm backend:test -- tests/test_ic_lora.py`

## CI Checks

PRs must pass: `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm backend:test` + frontend Vite build.

## Frontend Architecture

- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `frontend/*`
- **State management**: React contexts only (`ProjectContext`, `AppSettingsContext`, `KeyboardShortcutsContext`) — no Redux/Zustand
- **Routing**: View-based via `ProjectContext` with views: `home`, `project`, `playground`
- **IPC bridge**: All Electron communication through `window.electronAPI` (defined in `electron/preload.ts`)
- **Backend calls**: Always use `backendFetch` from `frontend/lib/backend.ts` for app backend HTTP requests (it attaches auth/session details). Do not call `fetch` directly for backend endpoints.
- **Styling**: Tailwind with custom semantic color tokens via CSS variables; utilities from `class-variance-authority` + `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`
- **No frontend tests** currently exist

### Component Reuse Priority

When implementing UI features, always prefer existing components before building new ones. Follow this priority order:

1. **Project UI components** (`frontend/components/ui/`): Check `button.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, `progress.tsx`, `tooltip.tsx` first. These are the project's standard building blocks.
2. **Shared project components** (`frontend/components/`): Reuse existing modals, dialogs, panels, and domain-specific components.
3. **Installed libraries**: Use already-installed packages before proposing new ones. Current UI libraries:
   - `lucide-react` — icon library
   - `class-variance-authority` + `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` — styling utilities
   - `cmdk` — searchable combobox/command palette
   - `react-dropzone` — file drag-and-drop
4. **New library proposals**: Only suggest adding a new dependency if the first three options are insufficient. Present the trade-off (bundle size, maintenance burden) and let the user decide.

**Never** hand-roll complex interaction patterns (dropdowns with search, focus management, portal rendering, keyboard navigation) when a vetted library already exists. Custom implementations of these patterns accumulate edge-case bugs and waste iteration cycles.

## Backend Architecture

Request flow: `_routes/* (thin) → AppHandler → handlers/* (logic) → services/* (side effects) + state/* (mutations)`

Key patterns:
- **Routes** (`_routes/`): Thin plumbing only — parse input, call handler, return typed output. No business logic.
- **AppHandler** (`app_handler.py`): Single composition root owning all sub-handlers, state, and lock
- **State** (`state/`): Centralized `AppState` using discriminated union types for state machines (e.g., `GenerationState = GenerationRunning | GenerationComplete | GenerationError | GenerationCancelled`)
- **Services** (`services/`): Protocol interfaces with real implementations and fake test implementations. The test boundary for heavy side effects (GPU, network).
- **Concurrency**: Thread pool with shared `RLock`. Pattern: lock→read/validate→unlock→heavy work→lock→write. Never hold lock during heavy compute/IO.
- **Exception handling**: Boundary-owned traceback policy. Handlers raise `HTTPError` with `from exc` chaining; `app_factory.py` owns logging. Don't `logger.exception()` then rethrow.
- **Naming**: `*Payload` for DTOs/TypedDicts, `*Like` for structural wrappers, `Fake*` for test implementations

### Backend Testing

- Integration-first using Starlette `TestClient` against real FastAPI app
- **No mocks**: `test_no_mock_usage.py` enforces no `unittest.mock`. Swap services via `ServiceBundle` fakes only.
- Fakes live in `tests/fakes/`; `conftest.py` wires fresh `AppHandler` per test
- Pyright strict mode is also enforced as a test (`test_pyright.py`)

### Adding a Backend Feature

1. Define request/response models in `api_types.py`
2. Add endpoint in `_routes/<domain>.py` delegating to handler
3. Implement logic in `handlers/<domain>_handler.py` with lock-aware state transitions
4. If new heavy side effect needed, add service in `services/` with Protocol + real + fake implementations
5. Add integration test in `tests/` using fake services

## TypeScript Config

- Strict mode with `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`
- Frontend: ES2020 target, React JSX
- Electron main process: ESNext, compiled to `dist-electron/`
- Preload script must be CommonJS

## Python Config

- Python 3.13+ (per `.python-version`), managed with `uv`
- Pyright strict mode (`backend/pyrightconfig.json`)
- Dependencies in `backend/pyproject.toml`

## Change Control

This project uses a formal change request workflow managed by the `/change_request` skill.

- **When starting any new task, feature, or bug fix**: invoke `/change_request <title>` before writing implementation code.
- The skill handles: numbered change request folder creation, High Level Design (HLD) drafting, implementation plan generation, git branch setup, and user approval gating.
- **Always commit after each meaningful change** — do not leave uncommitted working tree state between tasks. Use `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3` to review changes, propose a commit message, and commit once the change is verified.
- Active change requests live in the `change-requests/` directory at the project root. Consult the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` of the active CR for current task scope and status.
